## SQL
<br>In this course, I will be using "adminer.cs50.net" for DB management
<br>postgresql inside python code

#### Basic sql syntax
* create
```sql
CREATE TABLE flights (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    origin VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    destination VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    duration INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```
* insert
```sql
INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ('New York', 'London', 415);
```
* delete
```sql
DELETE FROM flights WHERE destination = 'Tokyo';
```
* select
```sql
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE duration = 245; # not ==

SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin IN ('New York', 'Lima');

SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin LIKE '%a%'

SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY duration ASC LIMIT 3; # DESC

SELECT origin, COUNT(*) FROM flights GROUP BY origin HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
* update
<br> can be used to inser a new column. cf. "insert" is for inserting rows
```sql
UPDATE flights SET duration = duration + 15 WHERE origin = 'New York' AND destination = 'London';
```
* foreign key constraint
```sql
CREATE TABLE passengers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    flight_id INTEGER REFERENCES flights #linking tables together by referencing PRIMARY KEY(usually id)
);
```
* join
```sql
# after ON? how tables are related
SELECT origin, destination, name FROM flights INNER JOIN passengers ON passengers.flight_id = flights.id;
SELECT origin, destination, name FROM flights JOIN passengers ON passengers.flight_id = flights.id WHERE passengers.name = 'Alice';
# LEFT/RIGHT JOIN? select everything in l/r table even though there's no match
SELECT origin, destination, name FROM flights LEFT OUTER JOIN passengers ON passengers.flight_id = flights.id;
SELECT origin, destination, name FROM flights RIGHT OUTER JOIN passengers ON passengers.flight_id = flights.id;
```
* index
```sql
# add index for particular column
CREATE INDEX duration_index ON flights (duration);
```

#### Security issue
* sql injection
* race condition : when there's simultaneous access, sequence matters -> "commit"

#### SQLAlchemy
* import .csv file and insert information to database
```python
import csv
import os

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker

engine = create_engine(os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"))
db = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=engine))

def main():
    f = open("flights.csv")
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for origin, destination, duration in reader:
        db.execute("INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES (:origin, :destination, :duration)", # place holder
                    {"origin": origin, "destination": destination, "duration": duration}) # feed dict
        print(f"Added flight from {origin} to {destination} lasting {duration} minutes.")
    db.commit() # start running!

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
* list flights, and passengers for a certain flight
```python
def main():
    # List all flights.
    flights = db.execute("SELECT id, origin, destination, duration FROM flights").fetchall()
    for flight in flights:
        print(f"Flight {flight.id}: {flight.origin} to {flight.destination}, {flight.duration} minutes.")

    # Prompt user to choose a flight.
    flight_id = int(input("\nFlight ID: "))
    flight = db.execute("SELECT origin, destination, duration FROM flights WHERE id = :id", {"id": flight_id}).fetchone()

    # Make sure flight is valid.
    if flight is None:
        print("Error: No such flight.")
        return

    # List passengers.
    passengers = db.execute("SELECT name FROM passengers WHERE flight_id = :flight_id", {"flight_id": flight_id}).fetchall()
    print("\nPassengers:")
    for passenger in passengers:
        print(passenger.name)
    if len(passengers) == 0:
        print("No passengers.")
```
* list flights using html template
```
<div class="form-group">
    <select class="form-control" name="flight_id">
        {% for flight in flights %}
            <option value="{{ flight.id }}">{{ flight.origin }} to {{ flight.destination }}</option>
        {% endfor %}
    </select>
</div>
```
```python
@app.route("/flights")
def flights():
    """Lists all flights."""
    flights = db.execute("SELECT * FROM flights").fetchall()
    return render_template("flights.html", flights=flights)
```
* list details about a single flight using html template
```
<ul>
    <li>Origin: {{ flight.origin }}</li>
    <li>Destination: {{ flight.destination }}</li>
    <li>Duration: {{ flight.duration}} minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Passengers</h2>
<ul>
    {% for passenger in passengers %}
        <li>{{ passenger.name }}</li>
    {% else %}
        <li>No passengers.</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```
```python
@app.route("/flights/<int:flight_id>") # placeholder
def flight(flight_id):
    """Lists details about a single flight."""

    # Make sure flight exists.
    flight = db.execute("SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id = :id", {"id": flight_id}).fetchone()
    if flight is None:
        return render_template("error.html", message="No such flight.")

    # Get all passengers.
    passengers = db.execute("SELECT name FROM passengers WHERE flight_id = :flight_id",
                            {"flight_id": flight_id}).fetchall()
    return render_template("flight.html", flight=flight, passengers=passengers)
```
* book a flight
<br>select tag is used to create drop down
```
<form action="{{ url_for('book') }}" method="post">
    <div class="form-group">
        <select class="form-control" name="flight_id">
            {% for flight in flights %}
                <option value="{{ flight.id }}">{{ flight.origin }} to {{ flight.destination }}</option>
            {% endfor %}
        </select>
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
        <input class="form-control" name="name" placeholder="Passenger Name">
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Book Flight</button>
    </div>
</form>
```
```python
@app.route("/book", methods=["POST"])
def book():
    """Book a flight."""

    # Get form information. The form exists in prev url(because the method is post)
    name = request.form.get("name")
    try:
        flight_id = int(request.form.get("flight_id"))
    except ValueError:
        return render_template("error.html", message="Invalid flight number.")

    # Make sure the flight exists.
    if db.execute("SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id = :id", {"id": flight_id}).rowcount == 0:
        return render_template("error.html", message="No such flight with that id.")

    db.execute("INSERT INTO passengers (name, flight_id) VALUES (:name, :flight_id)",
            {"name": name, "flight_id": flight_id})
    db.commit()
    return render_template("success.html")
```
